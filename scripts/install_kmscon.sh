# SCRIPT: install_kmscon.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Installs kmscon on a Linux system (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint) and configures

# USAGE:       install_kmscon.sh
# OPTIONS:     None.
# ==============================================================================
# Version: 0.0.1
# Author:  HA Bash Menu Development Team
# This script installs kmscon on a Linux system. Great for a headless base system without a GUI that doesn't
# install a system with a frame buffer
# It is intended for use on systems that use systemd and have access to the necessary package repositories.

# Check for incompatible environments (Termux / WSL)
