# SCRIPT: install_scripts.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Clones a private scripts repository from Github into a local
#              directory. Uses get_api_key.sh to securely fetch the Git PAT.
# USAGE:       install_scripts.sh
# OPTIONS:     None.
# ==============================================================================

# Personal script to clone a private repo from Github. Uses get_api_key.sh to retrieve
# an api key via ssh from another pc on the local network. 

# Get the directory that the script is located in:
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd -P "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/scripts"

# Make sure our target directory exists
mkdir -p "$INSTALL_DIR" &>/dev/null

# cd into our target directory or exit with error because it still doesn't exist
cd "$INSTALL_DIR" &>/dev/null || exit 1

# Check if the directory is empty or not. If it's not, it might already have scripts installed:
if [ -n "$(ls -A "$INSTALL_DIR" 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    echo "Directory is NOT empty, aborting git clone."
    exit 1
else
    # Clone the private git repository into ~/$INSTALL_DIR
    echo "Directory is empty, cloning git repository."
    # The '.' at the end tells git to install in the current directory, instead of creating a new folder in the 
    # current directory
    git clone "https://HappyAmos:$("$SCRIPT_DIR/get_api_key.sh" "gitpat.txt")@github.com/HappyAmos/scripts.git" .
